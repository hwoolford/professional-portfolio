              As a former educator transitioning into the realm of full-stack
              web development, I bring a unique blend of skills and experiences
              to the table. Armed with a web development certificate from the
              University of New Hampshire, I am eager to merge my background in
              education with the fast-paced and dynamic field of web
              development.
              <br />
              <br />
              Throughout my career in education, I have finely honed my
              communication, problem-solving, and collaboration abilities, all
              of which I am excited to now apply to crafting innovative web
              solutions. Proficient in both front-end and back-end technologies,
              I possess a meticulous attention to detail and an insatiable drive
              for continuous learning.
              <br />
              <br />I am genuinely enthusiastic about leveraging my diverse
              experiences to embark on a fulfilling journey in the creation of
              impactful and user-centric web solutions.
